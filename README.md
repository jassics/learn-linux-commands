# Learn Linux Commands with examples
Learn Linux Commands with examples which are useful for developers, system admin, security folks and other tech professionals.
This guide moves from foundational knowledge to specialized tools for system administration and security, emphasizing practical, real-world examples.

### The Linux Philosophy: Combining Tools

Before we dive in, remember the core philosophy of the Linux command line: **small, single-purpose tools that can be combined to perform complex tasks.** This is done primarily through:

* **Piping (`|`)**: Sends the output of one command as the input to another.
* **Redirection (`>` and `>>`)**: Sends output to a file, overwriting (`>`) or appending (`>>`).
* **Chaining (`&&` and `;`)**: Executes commands sequentially. `&&` only runs the next command if the previous one succeeds.

### üïµÔ∏è File Analysis & Forensics

Crucial for security investigations, reverse engineering, and debugging.

#### `file` - Determine File Type
* **What it does**: Inspects a file's header to determine its type, rather than just relying on the extension.
* **Examples**:
    * Identify an unknown executable: `file unknown_binary`
    * Check if a file is a script or a compiled program: `file my_script`

#### `strings` - Find Printable Strings in Files
* **What it does**: Extracts human-readable text strings from binary or data files. Incredibly useful for finding clues in unknown executables.
* **Example**:
    * Look for IP addresses, URLs, or plaintext secrets in a compiled program: `strings /usr/bin/sshd | grep "OpenSSH"`

#### `diff` - Compare Files Line by Line
* **What it does**: Shows the differences between two text files. Essential for tracking changes in code or configuration.
* **Example**:
    * Compare the old and new versions of a config file: `diff httpd.conf.old httpd.conf.new`

### üíª User & Remote Session Management

Commands for managing remote access and seeing who is on the system.

#### `ssh` - Secure Shell
* **What it does**: The standard for securely connecting to and managing remote Linux servers.
* **Examples**:
    * Connect to a server as a specific user: `ssh user@remote-host.com`
    * Connect on a different port: `ssh user@remote-host.com -p 2222`
    * **Pro Tip**: Use key-based authentication instead of passwords for vastly improved security.

#### `scp` / `rsync` - Secure Copy / Remote Sync
* **What it does**: Securely copies files over an SSH connection. `scp` is simple; `rsync` is more powerful for syncing directories and can resume transfers.
* **Examples**:
    * Copy a local file to a remote server with `scp`: `scp localfile.txt user@remote-host.com:/remote/dir/`
    * Sync a local directory to a remote server with `rsync`: `rsync -avz --progress ./local-project/ user@remote-host.com:/var/www/project`

#### `who` / `w`
* **What it does**: Shows who is currently logged into the machine. `w` provides more detail, including what command each user is running.
* **Example**: `w`

#### `last`

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Tools & Command-Line Utilities

These commands enhance your ability to combine and control other programs.

#### `xargs` - Execute Command Lines from Standard Input
* **What it does**: Builds and executes commands from standard input. It's the perfect companion to `find`.
* **Example**:
    * Find all files ending in `.tmp` and delete them efficiently: `find . -name "*.tmp" -print0 | xargs -0 rm`
        * The `-print0` and `-0` flags handle filenames with spaces correctly.

#### `tee` - Read from Stdin, Write to Stdout and Files
* **What it does**: Splits the output of a command, allowing you to see it on the screen *and* save it to a file at the same time.
* **Example**:
    * Run a script and save its output to a log file without losing the live view: `./run-tests.sh | sudo tee /var/log/test-run.log`

#### `lsof` - List Open Files
* **What it does**: A powerful diagnostic tool that lists all files currently opened by processes. Since Linux treats everything as a file (including network sockets), you can use it for many things.
* **Examples**:
    * Find out which process is using port 80: `sudo lsof -i :80`
    * See all files opened by a specific process (PID 1234): `sudo lsof -p 1234`

Adding these to your tutorial will give your audience a more complete and powerful command-line toolkit.
